Python Automated Helpdesk System

A powerful helpdesk system designed to streamline ticket management, comments, attachments, and employee vacation requests. Features custom user models: Regulars (standard employees) and Agents (issue resolution team). The backend is built with Python and Django, and the frontend uses a Bootstrap template, which accounts for the extensive CSS.
